# Sirene track

[Sirene](https://www.sirene.fr/sirene/public/accueil) is the official database of French enterprises (legal units) and establishments (local units). Created and managed by Insee since 1973, this database now includes more than 10 million units and is continuously updated. Since the beginning of 2017, Sirene is available as open data.

This challenge consists in proposing a RDF modelization for Sirene data, by re-using existing ontologies when possible.

# BPE track

The [Permanent database of facilities](https://www.insee.fr/en/metadonnees/source/serie/s1161) (BPE for Base permanente des Ã©quipements) offers information on the level of facilities and services a territory provides for its population. It lists more than 2.5 million facilities of a wide range of different types with their main characteristics, most of which are geolocalized.

The data and metadata available are:
* The 2018 edition of the BPE in RDF
* The corresponding data model in OWL
* The code lists used, expressed as SKOS
* Quality metadata on the geolocalization
